## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- In the cart section of the website, when you click on a given cart button, a JavaScript alert should pop up, letting you know that your item was added.  
- Added items will appear in the cart section in the top right-hand corner of the website.  
- The total amount of the added items will show in the running total.  
- When you delete an item, change should reflect in the cart.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

1) Work ongoing. DOM manipulation learning continues. 

### Continued development

1) This was my second real respectable JavaScript project done with no cloning. Trying to build from the ground up, so picking challenges I can complete independently with no cloning, aside "stackoverflow research".   

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow, MDN Web Docs, w3schools, YouTube, Google
